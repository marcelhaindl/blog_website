# Marcel Haindl (cc221005) FWOC Project
The project displays the soundboard and the game we did in class and also a new item, called blog. The Blog item is used to display different blogs using Markdown (md) files. By using markdown files it is easy to add more and more blogs to the app by simply adding several md files to the `/content/blog` folder inside the project.
